🚀 Java DSA Mastery: From Logic to Advanced Algorithms
Welcome to my dedicated repository for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Java. This repo serves as a comprehensive documentation of my journey through computer science fundamentals, problem-solving techniques, and complex algorithmic implementations.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Java (JDK 21+)

Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Focus: Logic Building, Time & Space Complexity Optimization

📈 Learning Roadmap
🏁 Phase 1: Java Fundamentals
The foundation of logic and syntax.

Flowcharts & Pseudocode: Visualizing logic before coding.

Variables & Data Types: Deep dive into memory storage.

Operators: Arithmetic, Logical, Bitwise, and Assignment.

Control Flow: Conditional Statements (If-else, Switch) and Ternary operators.

Loops: Mastering while, for, and do-while.

Functions & Methods: Scope, parameters, and method overloading.

🧱 Phase 2: Basic Data Structures
Transitioning from syntax to structure.

Arrays: 1D & 2D Matrices, Searching (Linear/Binary), and Basic Sorting.

Strings: Immutability, StringBuilder, and pattern matching.

Bit Manipulation: Get, Set, Clear, and Update bits; Fast Exponentiation.

OOPS: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, and Encapsulation.

🧪 Phase 3: Intermediate DSA
The heart of problem-solving.

Recursion: From basics to Advanced (Tower of Hanoi, Tiling).

Divide & Conquer: Merge Sort and Quick Sort implementations.

Backtracking: N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, and Grid Ways.

ArrayLists: Understanding dynamic sizing and internal mechanics.

Linked Lists: Singly, Doubly, and Circular; Cycle detection algorithms.

📏 Phase 4: Linear Data Structures (Advanced)
Stacks: Implementation using Arrays/LL; Reversing stacks and strings.

Queues: Circular Queues, Implementation using Stacks, and Deque.

🌳 Phase 5: Non-Linear Data Structures
Binary Trees: Traversals (Pre/In/Postorder), Height, Count, and Sum.

Binary Search Trees (BST): Build, Search, Delete, and Validation.

Heaps / Priority Queues: Heap Sort, Insertion, and Deletion.

Hashing: Custom HashMap/HashSet implementation; Chaining & Open Addressing.

Tries: Prefix trees for efficient word searching and insertion.

🕸️ Phase 6: Advanced Algorithms
Graphs: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford, Prim’s, and Kruskal’s.

Dynamic Programming (DP): Memoization vs. Tabulation (Knapsack, LCS).

Segment Trees: Optimized Range queries and updates.
